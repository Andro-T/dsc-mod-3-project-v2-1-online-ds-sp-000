# Module 3 Project - Customer Churn Analysis

![](churn.jpeg)

## Introduction

In an attempt to reduce Customer Churn, we will be running an analysis to understand what is leading Customer Churn at Syriatel and what can be done to stop it. This is important to retain strong bottom line business fundamentals by maintaining revenue while avoiding new customer acquisition costs.


## Objectives

- Which customers are the most likely to churn?
- After which time-period do the largest number of churns occur?
- What things can SyriaTel do to reduce customer churn?
- Which new customers should be targeted with new marketing campaigns?


## The Process

We will be using the OSEMN Data Science workflow to guide our approach to this problem. OSEMN is structured as follows:

- **Obtain** - Gather date
- **Scrub** - Clean data into usable formats
- **Explore** - Find patters and trends
- **Model** - Build  a predictive model and test it
- **Interpret** - Turn the results into actionable insight

The outcome of all this will, hopefully, be actionablr insights for SyriaTel to increase their customer retention.
